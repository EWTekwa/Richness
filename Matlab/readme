Instructions:

1. Run the "biodiversitySamplingSim.m" script to evaluate species richness estimators using simulated scenarios. The script calls "RichnessEsts.m", which is the function that takes in spatial abundance data and returns richness estimates, including Richness_raw, Chao1, GP, Chao2, ACE, S_aj2 (Jackknife_abundance), S_ij2 (Jackknife_incidence), Richness_apx (the proposed estimator 𝛺), Richness_taylor (the proposed Taylor expansion version 𝛺T), and Richness_0 (the proposed one-term approximate version 𝛺o). The script also calls "RichnessEsts_ideal.m", which is the analogous function to the previous that uses unobserved true quantities in the simulated data to return idealized richness estimates (𝛺c, 𝛺Tc, and 𝛺oc corresponding to the operational 𝛺, 𝛺T, and 𝛺o). Finally, the script calls "bootRichnessEsts.m" to generate bootstrap estimates that quantify estimators' precision. Simulation results used in manuscript are contained in "biodiversitySamplingSim_scenarios1_2.mat" and "biodiversitySamplingSim_scenarios3_4.mat" for reference.

2. Run the "runEmpiricalRichnessCorrection_BCI.m" script to analyze the Barro Colorado Island tree census dataset. The script first loads the empirical data contained in "bci.tree_abundance.mat". Full data and spatial subsampling and local downsampling experiments are analyzed. The script calls the function "bootRichnessEsts.m" to obtain bootstrapped samples of Chao1, Chao2, and 𝛺 estimates assuming dependencies of individuals within species and sites. The function calls "RichnessEsts.m" to obtain point estimates. Results used in manuscript are contained in "runEmpiricalRichnessCorrection_BCI.mat" for reference.

3. Run the "runEmpiricalRichnessCorrection_Seaweed.m" script to analyze the BC seaweed survey dataset. The script first loads the empirical data contained in "BC.seaweed_cover.mat". Full data and spatial subsampling and local downsampling experiments are analyzed. The script calls the function "bootRichnessEsts.m" to obtain bootstrapped samples of Chao1, Chao2, and 𝛺 estimates assuming dependencies of individuals within species and sites. The function calls "RichnessEsts.m" to obtain point estimates. Results used in manuscript are contained in "runEmpiricalRichnessCorrection_Seaweed.mat" for reference.
